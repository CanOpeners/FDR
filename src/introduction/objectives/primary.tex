The primary objectives of the satellite are to gather and transmit outside temperature and atmospheric pressure.
Additionally, our satellite will collect more raw sensor data and transmit it. The data will also help us with the secondary missions.
The ground station will receive and analyze sensor readings. The ground station computer will utilize an Yagi antenna to capture readings and analyze the data.
Our current idea is to have our satellite descend very slowly, near the lower bound of the allowed descend speed range.
We plan for the data to be used for a multitude of reasons, including the analisis of the atmosphere's state.
The satellite is to also have an accelerometer, a GPS receiver and perhaps some form of camera, to further increase the range of data collected.
